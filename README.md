The goal of this project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

I won't implement all the features only some of them to cover all the fundamental concepts.

After the completion of this project I should have a complete web application composed by:
 - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface like a shell(perfect for development and debugging)
 - A website (front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: both static and dynamic
 - A database or files that store data(data = objects)
 - An API that provides a communication interface between the frontend and your data (retrieve, create, delete and update them CRUD)

## HOW THE FINAL PRODUCT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
